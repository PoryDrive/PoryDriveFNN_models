# PoryDriveFNN_models
PoryDriveFNN trained models from 1GB and 2GB datasets.

All these are trained with the default Tensorflow Keras weight initialiser [GlorotNormal](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers/GlorotNormal).

#### notes
`tanh` and `selu` seem to perform best.
`softsign` and `relu` seems to have potential.
